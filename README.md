👋 Hi, I’m @timtalkstech<br>
👀 I’m interested in DIY hosting/development<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning about state machines (RP2040 PIO's)<br>
💞️ I love sushi<br>
📫 gmail is decent to reach me < timtalkstechmb@gmail.com ><br>
😄 I'm from Myrtle Beach, SC<br>
⚡ Fun fact: My first computer was an x286 when I was three!<br>
<br>
This repository is for the source code and dev for my site, both to<br>
keep it togehter, and also to document it as the site's wiki. :)<br>

everything is copyleft for now <3
